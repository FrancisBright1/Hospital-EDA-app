st.markdown("""
We have grouped patients based on their age to enable clearer demographic analysis and healthcare insight.

**Age Groups:**
- **Children (0â€“17 years):** Includes minors, often attending pediatric or general clinics.
- **Young Adults (18â€“30 years):** Covers students and early-career individuals.
- **Adults (31 years and above):** Represents middle-aged and older patients, more likely to present with chronic conditions.

This categorization helps in identifying health trends, planning resource allocation, and understanding no-show behaviors across age brackets.

General Appointment Overview
            
â€¢	A large number of appointments were recorded across various departments and locations in Nigeria.
            
â€¢	The no-show rate is a significant metric and varies across demographics and departments.
            
â€¢	Average waiting time between booking and appointment is a critical factor influencing patient turnout.
________________________________________
Demographic Insights
            
â€¢	Gender Distribution shows a fairly balanced mix of male and female patients, though slightly more females attend hospital appointments.
            
â€¢	Age Group Distribution:
            
â€¢	Children (0-17) represent a smaller portion of appointments.
            
â€¢	Young Adults (18-30) form a major part of the patient population.
            
â€¢	Adults (31+) also make up a significant proportion, often related to chronic health issues.
            
â€¢	The most common age group for appointments varies by disease â€” younger patients are more represented in general clinics and pediatrics, while older adults dominate cardiology and internal medicine.
________________________________________
Geographical Insights
            
â€¢	Ibadan recorded the highest total number of appointments, while Lagos shows better attendance and lower no-show rates.
            
â€¢	Gender distribution by location is relatively balanced, but slight skews exist (e.g., more male patients in some regions like Kano).
________________________________________
Departmental Trends
            
â€¢	Departments such as General Medicine and Pediatrics received more appointments.
            
â€¢	Cardiology and Endocrinology saw higher no-show rates, possibly due to longer waiting periods or chronic conditions.
            
â€¢	Male patients are more frequent in departments like Surgery and Orthopedics, while females dominate Obstetrics/Gynecology and General OPD.
________________________________________
No-Show Analysis
            
â€¢	Patients without SMS reminders were more likely to miss their appointments.
            
â€¢	Patients with Health Insurance were more likely to show up.
            
â€¢	Wednesdays and Thursdays had slightly higher no-show patterns.
            
â€¢	Shorter waiting periods lead to higher attendance rates.
________________________________________
 Actionable Recommendations
            
â€¢	Enhance SMS Reminder System to improve appointment turnout.
            
â€¢	Promote Health Insurance as insured patients are more likely to keep appointments.
            
â€¢	Reduce Waiting Times streamline booking systems to ensure closer appointment dates.
            
â€¢	Target No-Show Hotspots like certain departments and weekdays for better scheduling.
